  "readme": "##Graphics library for Face Recognition\n\nThis library contains functions to calculate the position of \ncoordinates inside squares, and to partition squares into smaller \nsquares. This works to find out if a Parallelogram is inside another and \ngive an approximate about the position in which square is located\nin relation to another Parallelogram.\n\nConditions:\n    \n    1. The Parallelogram contains the faces or other property found (lips, eyes).\n    2. We can't assume a width or height for the images\n    3. We can't assume an orientation\n    4. We can't assume where will the faces be located.\n    5. We can't assume a square contains all the faces\n    6. We assume that the square containing the faces contains valid faces.\n   \n##Finding point in Parallelogram algorithm \n\nIn a Rectangle with the following positions:\n\n```\nA  B\n ⌜⌝\n ⌞⌟\nD  C\n```\n\nPoint `M` of coordinates `(x,y)` is inside the rectangle if\n\n    (0<AM⋅AB<AB⋅AB)∧(0<AM⋅AD<AD⋅AD)\n\n(scalar product of vectors)\n        \n",
